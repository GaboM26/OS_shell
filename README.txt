My w4118_sh works just like what is expected with the assignment.
I implemented cd and exit, while all other commands (I treat all things that
don't have a path attached to them as commands) print a "Unknown command"
error. cd takes one command line argument while exit takes no command line
arguments. Any extra command line arguments given into exit will still just
exit. In the case of cd, the first command line argument will be treated as
the directory to change to.
