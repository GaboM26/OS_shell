Reference List for W4118 Homework

1.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11824685/what-does-the-second-parameter-of-waitpid-mean,
used in order to remember a bit how the waitpid function worked and what
status was for

2. https://cs3157.github.io/www/2022-1/resources/guides/git-tutorial.html
Used in order for a refresher on how to use git

3. https://linuxhint.com/check-malloc-error-c/
I was unsure on how to handle a malloc error so I used this for reference

4. http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157/code/shell.c
Im not sure if this must be cited because it was shown in class, but I put
it here to be on the safe side. Looked at shell.c for the fork/exec lines of
code

5. https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/tools/include/nolibc/stdlib.h#L112
Given with OS lab spec, used for help to implement malloc and realloc. Note
that I don't directly implement a function named realloc, I just simply
wrote code that does the same thing as realloc and placed it at the bottom of
myGetLine() function

6. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ASCII-Table-wide.svg
Used to see the actual ASCII values of the corresponding chars to fill in the main.c file.
